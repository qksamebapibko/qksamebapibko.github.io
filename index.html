<p>Self-driven. Focused. Determined. High-energy. Blake DeBenon is a well rounded Computer Engineering (CE) undergraduate student currently studying at Texas A&M University. Blake has also previously studied at Sao Carlos University in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He is currently a 4rd year Senior working towards completing a Software Systems and Algorithms CE bachelor’s degree in May 2018. Having already taken several fundamental classes such as ‘Operating Systems’, ‘Design and Analysis of Algorithms’, 'Computer Human Interaction' and ‘Advanced Computer Architecture’, Blake plans to pursue further education into the relationship between computers and humans as it pertains to software systems. He hopes to further understand the aspects of computer-human interactions that users respond either positively or negatively to; he aims to make these interactions a more pleasant and appealing overall experience with the larger goal of making enhanced future products. Currently, during Blake’s scholastic career he has acquired a 3.765 GPA in his Computer Engineering classes.</p>

<p>Blake can be characterized as a disciplined student who strongly believes in the importance of resiliency in all aspects of life. He believes that if one expects to rebound from any failure, there are very few obstacles that cannot be overcome in life. Beyond education, Blake is an avid fitness enthusiast; each week he spends anywhere between 10-15 hours in rigorous physical training. Coupled with fitness, a healthy dietary lifestyle is crucial to Blake’s daily routine. Blake has worked on several projects outside of school including entirely replacing and upgrading the stereo systems on multiple cars, running a ‘Runescape’ private server which at its peak had over 250 active players, and currently EasyTrain, a algorithmic driven fitness application.</p>

<p>Currently, Blake is working a summer internship with Dell in Round Rock, Texas as a Server Validation Engineer/Process Improvement Manager.</p>

<p>Blake hopes to work on societally beneficial technologies in his future career. Specifically, he is interested in building automated cars to reduce the frequency of automobile accidents.</p>
